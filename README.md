- Hello, I’m @FeverDreamEmulator

I build musical devices and other hardware with electronics and microcontrollers.

I am always looking to share open-source knowledge, because that's how I got started. 
Please feel free to contact me regarding collaborations or improvements anytime. 
I also make some strange electronic music at soundcloud.com/feverdreamemulator, and am always interested in collaborating there as well. 

Thanks for stopping by!
